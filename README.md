# Memory-AI-App
Experienced IOS Swift Developer that worked with Voice & Vision AI Models and can build apps.

We are building an app for students to memorize notes.

The student will be able to make a photo from notes or ask for a topic to learn and then our AI will hold conversations and ask questions with follow ups until the student can break down complex topics into simple, digestible explanations and remember them.

You task will be:
- build and fine-tune the Voice AI (question & voice)
- implementing vision to process the photo
- developing the front-end and backend for the app
(based on figma designs and our conversations)
- managing the GitHub and Appstore deployment.
- fixing bugs (if any, once the app is live)
==================
To build an app for students to memorize notes using Voice AI and Vision AI models, we can break the task into a few key components:

    Voice AI for Question and Answer Interactions: This includes implementing speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to allow the app to ask questions and hold conversations with students.

    Vision AI for Photo Processing: Implement an image processing component to extract text from the photo of notes using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

    Developing the Front-End and Back-End: This involves designing the user interface, integrating the necessary APIs, handling user data, and managing app deployment.

    App Deployment: Setting up GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and handling App Store deployment.

Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Voice AI for Question and Answer Interaction (Using AI Models)

For the Voice AI part, we will be using Speech-to-Text (STT) to transcribe student responses and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to ask questions and provide feedback. We will leverage services like Google Cloud Speech API or Apple’s SiriKit, and OpenAI GPT-3 (or GPT-4) to power conversations.
Swift Code for Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech (iOS)

We can integrate Speech Framework for voice recognition and AVFoundation for speech synthesis.

1.1 Implement Speech-to-Text (STT) using Apple’s Speech Framework:

import Speech

class VoiceAssistant: NSObject, SFSpeechRecognizerDelegate {
    
    private let speechRecognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: Locale(identifier: "en-US"))!
    private var recognitionRequest: SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest?
    private var recognitionTask: SFSpeechRecognitionTask?
    private let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
    
    func startRecording() {
        // Ensure the device can handle speech recognition
        guard speechRecognizer.isAvailable else {
            print("Speech recognizer is not available.")
            return
        }

        // Create and configure the recognition request
        recognitionRequest = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
        let inputNode = audioEngine.inputNode
        recognitionRequest?.shouldReportPartialResults = true
        
        // Start the recognition task
        recognitionTask = speechRecognizer.recognizeSpeech(with: recognitionRequest!, completionHandler: { (result, error) in
            if let result = result {
                print("Recognized Text: \(result.bestTranscription.formattedString)")
            }
        })

        // Setup audio session
        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.record, mode: .measurement)
        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true, options: .notifyOthersOnDeactivation)

        // Start the audio engine
        inputNode.installTap(onBus: 0, bufferSize: 1024, format: inputNode.inputFormat(forBus: 0)) { (buffer, _) in
            self.recognitionRequest?.append(buffer)
        }
        audioEngine.prepare()
        try? audioEngine.start()
    }

    func stopRecording() {
        audioEngine.stop()
        recognitionRequest?.endAudio()
    }
}

1.2 Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) using AVFoundation:

import AVFoundation

class SpeechSynthesis {
    private var synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()

    func speak(text: String) {
        let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: text)
        utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
        utterance.rate = AVSpeechUtteranceDefaultSpeechRate
        synthesizer.speak(utterance)
    }
}

2. Vision AI for Image Processing (OCR)

To process photos, we will use Tesseract OCR or Apple Vision Framework to extract text from the image.
Swift Code for OCR using Vision Framework:

import Vision
import UIKit

class OCRProcessor: NSObject {

    func performOCR(on image: UIImage, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        guard let cgImage = image.cgImage else { return }
        
        let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest { request, error in
            guard let observations = request.results as? [VNRecognizedTextObservation], error == nil else {
                completion("Error processing text")
                return
            }
            
            let recognizedText = observations.compactMap { observation in
                return observation.topCandidates(1).first?.string
            }.joined(separator: "\n")
            
            completion(recognizedText)
        }
        
        let requestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: cgImage, options: [:])
        try? requestHandler.perform([request])
    }
}

3. Developing Front-End and Back-End for the App
3.1 Front-End (UI)

The front-end will be built using SwiftUI for iOS. We will need screens for:

    Camera view to capture the notes.
    A chat interface for AI interactions (question-answer sessions).
    A learning progress screen to track student performance.

SwiftUI Example for the Main Screen:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var recognizedText = ""
    @State private var aiResponse = "Ask me a question to start learning!"
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Memorize Your Notes")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .padding()
            
            Text("Recognized Text: \(recognizedText)")
                .padding()
            
            Button(action: {
                // Trigger OCR process to recognize notes image
                captureImageAndRecognizeText()
            }) {
                Text("Capture Notes")
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
            }
            
            Button(action: {
                // Start AI interaction
                startAIInteraction()
            }) {
                Text("Start Learning")
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.green)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
            }
            
            Text(aiResponse)
                .padding()
            
        }
    }

    func captureImageAndRecognizeText() {
        // Capture the photo and process it with OCR
        OCRProcessor().performOCR(on: UIImage(named: "notes.jpg")!) { text in
            recognizedText = text
        }
    }
    
    func startAIInteraction() {
        // Start voice interaction or text-based AI learning
        let speechSynthesis = SpeechSynthesis()
        speechSynthesis.speak(text: "Tell me what you remember from your notes.")
        
        // Simulate AI response (replace with actual API integration)
        aiResponse = "Great! Let's break down the topic into small pieces."
    }
}

4. Backend Development

For backend, we can use Node.js or Python (FastAPI) to manage user data, learning progress, and AI models. You will also need an API to interact with your AI models for question-answer interactions.

Example Python FastAPI Backend for AI Interactions:

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai

app = FastAPI()

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

class Question(BaseModel):
    question_text: str

@app.post("/ask/")
async def ask_question(question: Question):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=question.question_text,
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return {"answer": response.choices[0].text.strip()}

Example API Interaction from iOS (Swift):

import Foundation

func askAI(question: String, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
    let url = URL(string: "https://your-backend-url/ask/")!
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    let body = ["question_text": question]
    request.httpBody = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: body, options: .fragmentsAllowed)
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")

    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
        if let data = data, let json = try? JSONDecoder().decode([String: String].self, from: data), let answer = json["answer"] {
            completion(answer)
        }
    }
    task.resume()
}

5. GitHub & App Store Deployment
5.1 GitHub Setup:

    Create a GitHub repository for the project.
    Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI/CD) to deploy updates to the app and backend.

Example GitHub Action for iOS app build:

name: Build iOS App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Xcode
        uses: apple-actions/setup-xcode@v1
        with:
          xcode-version: '13.2'
      - name: Build app
        run: |
          xcodebuild -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme YourScheme -sdk iphoneos -configuration Release clean build

5.2 App Store Deployment:

Once your app is built and tested, use Xcode to archive your app and deploy it to the App Store.

You can automate this with Fastlane.

Conclusion

This project integrates Voice AI and Vision AI with an iOS app. The app captures notes, interacts with students through AI-driven conversations, and helps them learn. The backend supports AI processing and user data management, and the app is ready for deployment via GitHub Actions and Fastlane to the App Store.

You can iterate on this by fine-tuning the AI model (e.g., GPT-4 or specialized models) and adding advanced features for better learning experiences.
